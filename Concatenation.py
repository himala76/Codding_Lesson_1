# Python lets you join two strings together to form a new string

# this is the result we want to have in the console
print "Hello, world! my name is Himala"

#this line to get space between lines
print""
# create a variable to represent name and intro statement to print
name    =   "Himala"
intro_statement =   "Hello, world! my name is "

#print the Concatenate string
print intro_statement + name +"."
