# Create an integer variable
my_favorite_number = 7

# Create a string variable
my_name = "Josh"

# This will give us a type error
print "Hello, world! My name is " + my_name + " and my favorite number is " + my_favorite_number

# Using the str function to convert the type of my_favorite_number will fix the problem
# print "Hello, world! My name is " + my_name + " and my favorite number is " + str(my_favorite_number)

# This will also work. This effectively tells the print statement to print 4 individual things so type doesn't matter
# print "Hello, world! My name is ", my_name,  " and my favorite number is ", my_favorite_number
